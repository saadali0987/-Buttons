# üçîButtons

responive one page resturant website. It consists of a navigationbar, home section, popular dishes section, about us section, menu section, reviews section, place order section and finally a footer. I have used flexbox intensively throughout the project and feel great with my flexbox skills now. Grid could have been better at some areas but i choose to strengthen my flexbox skills.

The project is essentialy done but I hope to comeback later with improved css skills to make it better. Maybe I can convert this into a React project later someday and maybe even have a backend to get all the images and other products data instead of having them hardcoded. Also add a working feedback section.  



P.S the name is inspired by my late pet dog buttons.
